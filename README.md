## 🧪 Testing Prompts

Here are a few prompts you can use to test the core features. They’ll help you check how well it handles translation accuracy, whether RAG is working properly, and how smooth and user-friendly the interaction flow is.

---

### 1️⃣ Core Translation Test (General)

This prompt checks if the agent can perform a basic translation and use its RAG system for a technical term.

**Prompt:**

> "Hello, I need to translate a document into Hindi. The subject is Biology. The document's content is:  
> 'Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. The primary chlorophyll molecule in the process is Photosystem II.'"

**Image Preview:**

---

### 2️⃣ Pedagogical Context Test

This prompt checks if the agent preserves the instructional tone and context of the original content.

**Prompt:**

> "I need this student note translated into Tamil. The original text is:  
> 'Before we begin today's lecture on quantum mechanics, please review the first chapter of your textbook. We will discuss the uncertainty principle in detail.'  
> The subject is Physics."

**Image Preview:**

---

### 3️⃣ Specific Terminology Check (Advanced RAG)

This tests if the agent can follow a specific instruction and prioritize a particular term's accuracy.

**Prompt:**

> "Please translate the following legal text into Bengali. The subject is Law.  
> 'The court ruled that the defendant's plea was non-justiciable.'  
> For the translation, ensure that the term 'non-justiciable' is translated correctly according to legal and constitutional frameworks."

**Image Preview:**

---

### 4️⃣ Interaction Flow Check (Incomplete Request)

This tests if the agent follows its designed interaction flow by asking for missing information.

**Prompt:**

> "Hi, I have the following text about the history of the Mughal Empire. Can you translate it?  
> 'Akbar, also known as Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar, was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605.'"
